### Tecnologies âš¡

The most projects I have worked on have been based on the MS SQL Server Suite (Microsoft Certified Professional MCSE - MCT), using its main components (MSSQL, SSIS, SSAS and SSRS) and different visualizations tools such as Power BI, Tableu and Qlick.

I have experience using Power Query for PBI, DAX and MDX for SSAS models and currently IÂ´m advancing with Python for data science and Looker for data analysis in GCP.
